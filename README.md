# JSM_2024_ContinuousCoordination
Code for the numerical approximation of solutions to the continuous coordination non-local PDE

This code shows how solutions to the continuous coordination non-local PDE evolve in time. In both the 1D and 2D cases the numberical methods are very simple. To use this code, find where the initial condition, familiarity kernel, and recogntion functions are included in the code. If you wish to change any of these, replace them. (You cannot use a singular kernel). When you are ready to approximate your soluiton, run the sript and see the curve/surface change in the animation window 'figure 1'

Currently this code only supports the free boundary problem and does not approximate solutions to the initial boundary value problem. 
The theory behind the boundary value problem is not well understood
